# Madison_super_portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was designed to showcase who I am and the quality of my work in a clean yet unique and funky manner. I built this project to act as a resume when applying to jobs. This portfolio will act as a central hub for the three topics: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. When creating this portfolio, I was able to learn how to apply many advanced CSS techniques to reach my desired outcome on the webpage. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

- [About Me](#About-Me)
- [My Work](#My-Work)
